Hello there, name's Hadano or you can call me HK, either works. I'm an analyst and development of systems student, basically I learn about databases and software development,
both front and backend.

- Currently learning: C#, JavaScript, HTML, MySql, SqlServer.
- Want to learn: Ruby, Python, PHP, C++

I got a game project in mind, I'll probably make a step by step how I'll make it here.

- How to contact: Discord -> Myamoto#4283
(Why would ever contact me is beyond me)
